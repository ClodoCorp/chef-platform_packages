  "long_description": "# DESCRIPTION\n\nInstalling individual packages via attribute metadata. If your needs are complex\nor there is additonal config, then that should be in a standalone recipe/cookbook.\n\nMotivating use case is putting packages like *tree* on systems without cranking\nout a cookbook for it.\n\n# REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Supported Platforms\n\nThe following platforms are supported by this cookbook, meaning that the\nrecipes run on these platforms without error:\n\n* ubuntu\n* debian\n* arch\n* suse\n\n## Cookbooks\n\nNone.\n\n# ATTRIBUTES\n\n## `platform_packages`\n\nA list of packages (represented by a hash of properties) to be installed on\nthe system, all of which need no configuration. Each entry in the list is a\nhash containing attributes suitable to be passed to the\n[package resource](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Package).\nFor example:\n\n    node['platform_packages'] = [\n      { 'name'    => 'tree',\n        'action'  => 'upgrade'\n      }\n    ]\n\nThe default is an empty Array.\n\n# USAGE\n\nSimply include the `platform_packages` recipe and populate the\n`platform_packages` attribute list.\n\n# LICENSE and AUTHOR\n\nAuthor:: Fletcher Nichol (<fnichol@nichol.ca>)\n\nCopyright:: 2011, Fletcher Nichol\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
